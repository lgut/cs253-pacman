This is not a complete implementation of pacman. This exists simply to illustrate Dijsktra'spath finding algorithm at work.

Things to keep in mind:

- Edible ghost behavior is not implemented
- Once the player is close enough the ghost will begin to pursue you
- Once the ghost eats the player the game will exit and "Player has been eaten" will be printed to standard output
- start the game by running `./gradlew desktop:run` in the terminal
- game will start immediately upon launch

Controls:

W - up

s - down

a - left

d -right
